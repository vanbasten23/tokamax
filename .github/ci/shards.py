"""Test shard definitions for `.github/workflows/ci-build.yml`.

The test suite is too slow to run as a single job, so it is split into shards
that run in parallel, one GitHub Actions job per (shard, runner). `SHARDS`
below is the only place a shard is declared; the job matrix and the catch-all
shard are derived from it. Stdlib only, so CI can run this before installing
anything.

Every test file is named individually, and paths are written out in full, with
no directory targets, shared prefix constants, or interpolation. It is
repetitive, and that is the point: a shard's targets read the same way they
would on a pytest command line, every path can be found by grepping for it,
and a file that is deleted, renamed, or newly added shows up as a diff here
instead of silently changing what some directory expands to.

A file too slow to run in one job can be split across shards by pytest node
ID -- `path/to/test.py::SomeTest` -- at the class boundary. `check_consistency`
parses any file split this way and fails if it declares a class no shard names,
since such a class stops running without any path here going stale.

Usage:
  python3 .github/ci/shards.py matrix  # emit GitHub Actions outputs
  python3 .github/ci/shards.py check   # every test file is claimed by a shard
  python3 .github/ci/shards.py list    # human-readable summary

# Carried over from the SHARD_TEST_PATHS table in ci-build.yml, which this

#
#   "ignore that test the shard by default" was the `--ignore=` flag a
#   directory-targeted shard needed to carve out the files another shard had
#   claimed. No shard here targets a directory, so there is nothing to carve
#   out and no `--ignore=` anywhere in the table; see the note below.
#
#   "by timing, then by test area" is now the other way round. `shard_order`
#   groups by theme first and sorts longest-first inside each, so the job list
#   reads by area; the load balancing happens within a theme, not across the

#            fills in. Test files only: `check_consistency` rejects a
#            directory or a flag, both of which would break the coverage
#            model below.
#   minutes  measured wall clock, worst case across the runners the shard is
#            scheduled on. Set it only from a real run: omitting it means no
#            number yet, which is not the same as fast. The one exception is
#            the catch-all shard, where it is a target rather than a
#            measurement -- see its entry.
#
# There is no key for which runners a shard belongs on, and `Spec` has no
# field for one: every shard runs on every runner in `RUNNERS`. Restricting a
# shard is a follow-up, and when it comes it should be stated per test file
# rather than here -- a shard is a scheduling bucket, sized for wall clock and
# rebalanced whenever the timings move, so a per-file fact stated at shard
# granularity gets forced onto every file that happens to be grouped with it.
#
#            Every shard below is measured, from run 33423920015
#            (2026-08-31), a 72-job all-green run on all three runners. That
#            run's shards were coarser than these, so the numbers are not
#            copied across by name: they are per-file times recovered from the
#            job logs and re-summed against the `paths` here. pytest flushes a
#            progress line when the file finishes, so the timestamp on
#            `foo_test.py ....` is that file's end, and the gap back to the
#            previous one is its duration. The recovered per-file times account
#            for all but 0.5-0.9m of each job's wall clock, which is the
#            fixed cost either side of the pytest session.
#
#            Two traps, if this is ever redone.
#
#            The gap-back arithmetic needs every progress line, and a file
#            whose tests print to stdout does not produce a bare one: under
#            `-s`, `mla/pallas_mosaic_tpu_kernel_test.py` emits
#            `<path> Test case: ...`. Matching only `<path> <progress chars>`
#            drops it silently, and dropping it charges its time to whichever
#            file ran before it. Match on the path and take the rest as it
#            comes.
#
#            `attention/base_test.py` is split across two shards by node ID,
#            so its time is per class group, not per file: 28.9m for the two
#            classes in `attention-base` and 36.1m for the one in
#            `attention-base-vjp` on tpu6e. Summing the file to 65.0m and
#            giving that to both is the mistake to avoid. An earlier pass took
#            these from run 32866355103, whose shards also overlapped on
#            gmm_v2 -- `linear_softmax_and_experimental` ran it a second time
#            because of a stale `--ignore` path, since fixed in e6142dc.
#            Summing that overlap doubled `gmm-v2-perf` to 11m and
#            `gmm-v2-kernel` to 8m, which read as plausible drift and were
#            not. This run is post-fix, so base_test.py is the only overlap
#            left.
#
#            Rounded up to whole minutes, floored at 1, because the field must
#            be a positive number and 12 shards here finish in under a minute.
#            A 1 means "too fast to matter", not "measured at 60s".
#
# Every file is named. No shard targets a directory, which is why there are no
# `--ignore=` flags either: a directory target and the file shards carved out
# of it have to be kept in agreement, and naming files directly removes the
# thing they could disagree about. It costs a line per test file, and buys two
# checks a directory target cannot support -- a deleted or renamed file fails
# `check` by name rather than quietly shrinking a shard, and a *new* file is
# unclaimed rather than silently absorbed by whichever directory contained it.
# `check_consistency` enforces this: a directory target is an error, not a
# style preference.
#
# So adding a test file does require an edit here. Forgetting is not fatal:
# `resolve_shards` sweeps unclaimed files into the catch-all shard, where they
# run, but visibly, and their `--durations` tell you which shard has room for
# them. That is the catch-all's whole job, and it has now done it once: it
# measured 16m, all but a minute of which was
# `experimental/kda/pallas_mosaic_tpu_kernel_test.py`, a file nobody had ever
# scheduled and the fifth-longest job in CI. That is the mechanism working, so
# the fix was `experimental-kda-kernel` rather than a bigger catch-all, and
# this shard is back to reading as empty.
#
# Ordered by theme, longest first within each -- the same order `shard_order`
# produces, so this table, `python3 shards.py list`, and the job list all read
# the same way, and the first entry under a divider is the job that sets that
# theme's wall clock. It used to be measured-shards-first-then-the-rest, which
# stopped meaning anything once every shard had a number.
#
# Nothing enforces the order: `build_matrix` sorts by `shard_order` regardless,
# so an entry in the wrong place is a readability bug and not a CI one. If a
# `minutes` changes enough to move a shard, move it.
#
# Paths run past 80 columns rather than wrapping. This is the style guide's
# own exception -- "long string module-level constants not containing
# whitespace that would be inconvenient to split across lines such as URLs or
# pathnames" (Google Python style, 3.2) -- and not a limit worth working
# around here. The longest path is 90 characters, so it does not fit at any
# indentation, and the two ways to make it fit both cost more than they save:
# a wrapped path cannot be grepped for, which is half the reason paths are
# written out in full, and implicit concatenation inside a tuple is the exact
# shape of the bug this table exists to prevent -- drop a comma and two paths
# silently become one, which is how `ragged_dot_misc` lost an `--ignore`.
